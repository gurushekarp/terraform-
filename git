GIT BRANCH:
A branch represents an independent line of development.
The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
The default branch name in Git is master.

To see current branch                                 :             git branch
To add new branch                                     :             git branch branch-name
To switch branches                                     :             git checkout branch-name
To create and switch at a time                  :             git checkout -b branch-name
To rename a branch                                   :             git branch -m old new
To clone a specific branch                         :             git clone -b branch-name repo-URL
To delete a branch                                     :             git branch -d <branch>
To delete branch in github                        :              git push origin --delete branch_name

The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. 
Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet. 
The branch is now deleted locally.
============================================================================================================================================
GIT MERGE: 
If you want to merge branch-1 with branch-2 switch to branch-1 first and give command
COMMMAND: git merge branch-2

now that command had merged the content of branch-1 to branch-2.
Whatever the content in branch-1 will be seen in branch-2 now.
=============================================================================================================================================
GIT REBASE:
if you have 2 commits in master branch and only 1 commit in devops branch, to get all the commits from master branch to devops branch 
we can use rebase in git.  (command: git rebase branch_name)
============================================================================================================================================
GIT CHERRYPICK:
if you have 5 commits in master branch and only 1 commit in devops branch, to get specific commit from master branch to devops branch 
we can use cherry pick in git. (git cherry-pick commit_id).
=========================================================================================================================================
CONFLICTS:
GIT makes merging super easy! 
CONFLICTS generally araise when two people two people have changed the same lines in a file (or) if one developer deleted a file while another developer is working on the same file!
In this situation git cannot determine what is correct!

Lets understand in a simple way!

there are two developers called siri and alexa

siri created a file in master branch in a folder (file name: abc.txt, folder name: git_merge_conflict)
siri added some data in a file (Hey siri play a song) and commited it in a master branch 

alexa created a new branch called devops and overwrite the content in abc.txt (hey alexa! whats todays updates?)
alexa commited that file in devops branch

Now lets comeback to master branch and add some extra content in abc.txt file (hey siri! how are you) and commit it. 
If you see the data in abc.txt then the data will be: (Hey siri play a song & hey siri! how are you).
Now try to commit this file in master branch! 

now you can compare the data of both the branches! (both are different)! in this situation git is not aware which one is correct. Only developers knows!

so here you can observe siri and alexa is working on a same file but content is different (use command: git diff abc.txt).
In this case if siri or alexa try to merge their file then you will get an CONFLICT ERROR from GIT!

IDENTIFY CONFLICTS: see the file in master branch then you will see both the data in a single file including branch names
RESOLVE CONFLICTS: open file in VIM EDITOR and delete all the conflict dividers and save it!
add git to that file and commit it with the command (git commit -m "merged and resolved the conflict issue in abc.txt")



GIT STASH:
Using the git stash command, developers can temporarily save changes made in the working directory. It allows them to quickly switch contexts when they are not quite ready to commit changes. And it allows them to more easily switch between branches.
Generally, the stash's meaning is "store something safely in a hidden place." 

git stash
git stash apply
git stash list
git stash pop
git stash clear

GIT HUB: 
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control. 
It simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. 
Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.


ATTACH GIT TO GITHUB : git remote add origin REPO_URL

PUSH CODE FROM GIT TO GITHUB: git push -u origin branch-name

TO CLONE CODE: git clone REPO_URL

GIT FORK: A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project
